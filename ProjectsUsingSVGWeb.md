# Projects Using SVG Web Either Deployed or In Development #

  * **Browser Based AutoCad DXF Viewer**: An open source web-based application that can view AutoCad DXF files. Also uses the open source [Kabeja project](http://kabeja.sourceforge.net/), a Java application that runs on the server, to convert the DXF to SVG. [Blog post in Brazilian Portuguese](http://www.desenhe.com/node/15).
  * **[Star Atlas](http://www.staratlas.com/)**: Determines your geographic position and then dynamically draws a star chart based on the stars in the sky.
  * **[Election Atlas Germany wahlatlas.net](http://wahlatlas.net)**: (German for election atlas). Lets you analyze the regional patterns in election results and demographic data as well as previous election. General election in Germany is Sept 27th 2009. After polling stations close live results will be displayed using a performance optimized map where all the path data is embedded via the object tag as people are likely to hit reload very often - via @mneutze
  * **[Federal Statistical Office of Germany Animated Population Pyramid](http://www.destatis.de/bevoelkerungspyramide/)**: The Federal Statistical Office of Germany (think census bureau or national statistics) uses SVG Web in their latest animated population pyramid. Apart from supporting Internet Explorer SVG Web was a great choice for mixing SVG and HTML. Population projections only make sense when you know the assumptions and those can now be displayed side by side with the population pyramid using standard HTML, CSS and SVG. Check it out for yourself, it is available in english, french, german and russian at http://www.destatis.de/bevoelkerungspyramide/ Watch a short screencast in english to see all it can do http://vimeo.com/7687560 - via @mneutze
  * Wikipedia is working on an [SVG zoom tool](http://techblog.wikimedia.org/2009/07/svg-for-all-with-flash/) in conjunction with SVG Web.
  * See Flex SVG Explorer with sample SVG graphics from this project and clipart.org: http://www.randomfractals.com/lab/FlexSVGExplorer/FlexSVGExplorer.html Flex SVG Explorer uses SVG Web library to load SVG graphics in Flash and preview SVG markup. This app is open source and could be a good starting point for the demo or testing of SVG Web ActionScript api.
  * MoinMoin: Wiki Engine in Python. It is currently being built in moin/2.0-storage repo.
  * [Plugin for Ruby on Rails](http://github.com/imanel/svg_web/tree/master) based on SVG Web.
